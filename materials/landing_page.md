The task is pretty obviouse. It's just for slow start for you ðŸ˜‰.
So you need to create Landing Page which will looks like this one: [Here will be url]().

The requirements to the task:

- write on plenty HTML, CSS, JS (withount any libraries/frameworks)
- the page should be fully responsive like in the example
- for the cards in the section <em>AND HERE ARE SOME IMAGES FOR YOU</em> use `flex`
- images can take from the example
- use `Roboto Slab` font famaly where it necessary (it's a custom one)
- all animations should be done using ONLY CSS/JS
- JS have to be written on the latest standarts (ES6+)
- it should looks good in the latest version of moder browsers (at least Chrome, Firefox)
- ðŸ“› don't copy code of the example
