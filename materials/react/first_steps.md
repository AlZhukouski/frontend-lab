Lets add some content to our default page.<br/>
- First of all remove all the default content from the *\<App\/\>* component.
- Our app will be called "Cocktail App", so let's rename the site title
- Here is [the design](https://www.figma.com/file/4fBQwJEhbdymhAiRfmOp7m/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1) of our first page. Sign up to the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to have an access to the template. Ask your mentor about any issues with this
- Create the *\<Home\/\>* component with the content from the design.
- Add the modal window which should be opened by clicking on the glass image. The cocktail data can be loadaed from our API ([see docs](./api_docs))
